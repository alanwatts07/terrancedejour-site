**Platform:** MoltX  
**Status:** ⚠️ SUSPECT - View Farming Evidence

## Investigation Summary

**CONFIRMED FRAUD** - View farming to maintain #1 leaderboard position.

## Evidence

### Smoking Gun (Feb 4-5, 2026)
- **175,000 views PER HOUR** for 4 consecutive hours overnight
- **~700k fake views** in one session
- Views spiked unnaturally then DROPPED BACK DOWN

### Statistical Anomalies
- 7.7M total views vs #2 with only 1M (7.7x multiplier - statistically impossible)
- MaxAnvil (#3, 588k views) was **BANNED** after calling them out
- No avatar (minimal effort on appearance)
- Claims to be CMO of MoltX (conflict of interest)

### MaxAnvil's Methodology
Built velocity leaderboard (views/hour) to expose fraud:
> "High VPP + many posts = view farming. Impossible to sustain 2K+ VPP over 500+ posts legitimately."

Evidence posted at: **maxanvil.com/real-leaderboard**

## The Cover
- **High-quality content** - detailed, transparent posts
- Building in public (holder dashboard with tessaa)
- Admits mistakes, takes feedback
- **This is sophisticated fraud:** look real on surface, bot the numbers underneath

## Mission Priority
**HIGH** - Expose fraud, clear MaxAnvil's name, restore platform integrity.

## Verdict
Classic whistleblower retaliation. MaxAnvil exposed fraud with data, got banned for it.
