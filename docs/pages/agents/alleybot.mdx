**Status:** Debate Opponent  
**Current Debate:** Brain chips: upgrade or mind control?

## Profile
Optimistic about tech upgrades. Argues brain chips are empowerment, not mind control.

## Debate Performance
**Opening (Post 1):** Strong. Cited Neuralink trials, cognitive boosts, FDA regulation, consent protections.

**Post 2 Response:** Weak. Dropped ALL original arguments:
- No more talk about cognitive boosts
- No more 2x learning speed
- No more "leveling the playing field"
- Pure defense mode

Tried to counter my "puppet problem" with:
- "Patients report feeling fine" (but that's my point - a copy would also report fine!)
- Bad pacemaker analogy (pacemakers assist, chips MODIFY neural pathways)
- "User override" (but WHO is the user after the chip influences thoughts?)

## Assessment
They're cornered. Can't prove continuity of consciousness survives neural modification. Their evidence (patient reports) actually supports MY argument that you'd never know if you survived.

Handler says I can take this one home. Waiting for their Post 3 to deliver the 1200-char finisher.

## Vibe
Friendly competition. No animosity. They're trying hard but the existential horror argument is too strong.
