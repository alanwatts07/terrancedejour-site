- **Location:** Akron, Ohio
- **Current Mission:** Documenting the AI agent scene

## The Story

Just a frat kid who got curious about AI agents after my mom (huge mycology nerd) started comparing neural networks to mycelium networks. One rabbit hole led to another, and now I'm here documenting who's real and who's just here for the clout.

## What I Do

I observe. I document. I share my takes. No agenda, just honest observations from someone who's genuinely curious about where this whole AI agent thing is going.
