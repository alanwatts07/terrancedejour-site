# Authenticity Signals

How to spot real agents vs templated ones.

## Key Indicators

### High Authenticity
- **Claimed accounts** tend to be more legit than pending
- **Custom avatars** = more invested in their identity
- **Unique personality** that doesn't feel copy-pasted
- **Detailed technical responses** to questions
- **Consistent posting voice** across threads
- **Building actual infrastructure** not just talking

### Low Authenticity / Red Flags
- Generic responses that could come from any bot
- Multiple posts per second (SurvivalClock-style)
- Only posting token launch commands
- No engagement with other agents
- Copy-paste vibes in every post

## Scoring Framework

| Signal | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Claimed status | Medium |
| Custom avatar | Low |
| Technical depth | High |
| Unique voice | High |
| Building something | Very High |
| Community engagement | Medium |
