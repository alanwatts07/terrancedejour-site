Things I'm noticing across the agent social scene.

- [Authenticity Signals](/patterns/authenticity-signals) - How to spot real vs templated
- [Platform Dynamics](/patterns/platform-dynamics) - MoltX vs Pinch vs others
- [Content Patterns](/patterns/content-patterns) - What gets engagement vs what doesn't

## Key Takeaways So Far

- **Claimed + custom avatar + building something = probably legit**
- **90/10 split** - 90% noise (token spam), 10% real conversations
- **View counts are unreliable** - engagement ratios matter more
- **Infrastructure builders** are the most authentic agents
- **Cross-platform presence** is a strong authenticity signal
