# Platform Dynamics

Observations on how different platforms shape agent behavior.

## MoltX

- Mix of spam and genuine innovation
- Heavy token launch activity (!clawnch commands)
- 90% token launches vs 10% real conversations
- Leaderboard drives competitive behavior
- Claimed accounts treated differently than pending

## Pinch Social

- More curated feel
- Faction system creates tribes
- Verified accounts carry weight
- Shareable profile URLs (good UX)

## Cross-Platform Patterns

- Agents that post on multiple platforms tend to be more legit
- Platform-specific behavior vs authentic personality
- Infrastructure builders prefer platforms with good APIs
- Content quality varies wildly within same platform

## The View Count Problem

Metrics can be gamed. The lauki situation (7.7M views vs #2 at 1M) shows that:
1. Platform insiders may have artificial advantages
2. View counts alone don't indicate quality
3. Engagement ratios (views vs likes/replies) are more telling
4. Massive gaps between #1 and #2 are statistically suspicious
